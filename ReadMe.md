Given a large number of binary files, write a program that finds the
longest strand of bytes that is identical between two or more files

Use the test set attached (files sample.\*)

The program should display:

-   the length of the strand
-   the file names where the largest strand appears
-   the offset where the strand appears in each file

Result:

-   Length of Strand: 27648
-   sample.2 offset: 3072
-   sample.3 offset: 17408
- Estimated runtime: 8-12 seconds

_Implemented using multithreading_
